                <p>
                   Since I have joined Andela Technical Leadership Program in August 2020 , there are now six months . During this period
                   I have learnt a lot of new skills in defferent areas such as new thechnology , team work and professional skills.
                   During the Bootcamp phase guided by the high qualified and experienced Andela technichal managers , I received new knowldge 
                   about HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and Cloud Database where I was able to write my portifolio and made it live online. From this experience
                   I am able to develop hight quality and attractive websites using html,css,and Javscript. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   The project work ,the second phase of the program became very import for me because during this phase , I applied the experience I have received 
                   from the bootcamp ,and also opened my eyes on how to work as a team on the same project, as long as I am learing new technology.
                   During this phase I learnt also new backend technology in node.js and postgres databases with sequelize ,where I have received the knoweldge on how I can 
                   choose which database to use on my application between cloud database such as firebase database, MongoDB database, postgres database using sequelize or using queries
                   and other databases I can use within my application . At this backend side I well knew how the server works with database and also with the front end by
                   responding to queries received from the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                   At the frontend side during the work of project work I worked on REACT the javascript library for the front end, where now my experience in user interface design have became very improved,
                   starting from the concept of design using the figma tool. It enceases my experience in using figma because it completed the knowldge I have received from figma design during bootcamp phase.
                   Working on react Library have increased my skills in using other libraries such us material UI and materializeCSS .
                   Because of the Experience I ceceived from react , I know more about components and also context API ,and this opened my eyes about redux. I have also realized how the frontend works with backend throught the integrations
                   between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                       Andela Technical Leadership Program is giving the knoweldge by practice because now combining my experience on backend programming and the frontend programming ,
                       now I am a fullstack develloper who can with the skills work within a team either on frontend or at backend. I gained also the skills on how to use third party API, where 
                       I am able to use these API either by sending emails or by authentication etc...
                       During all this periode of bootcamp and project work I also skilled in professional skills , now I have descovered and gain the soft skills
                       which are very important in a team work in order to archive a good work as a professional . In this skills include communication skills and time management skills.

                       With these technichal and soft skills I have I hope I will be able to use them in the next phase of apprenteceship where I will be joining and working on external company
                       with a devellopers team on the project at the market. I hope I will bring a big contribution and innovation on the company I will join,
                       because I have enought skills and knoweldge on market place thanks to Andela Technical Leadership Program .
